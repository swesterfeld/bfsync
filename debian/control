Description: synchronization for collections of big files
 bfsync is a file-synchronization tool that allows you to keep a collection
 of big files synchronized on many machines. It is built around a FuSE filesystem,
 so repositories can be mounted and the contents can be viewed and modified
 via the mount point.
 .
 A collection of commands like commit/push/pull/put/get can be used to control
 bfsyncs behaviour, and trigger data / history transfers between machines. In
 addition to synchronizing files between many machines, bfsync can also be used
 to store backups.
