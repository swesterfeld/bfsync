Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.6:

* boost related build fixes
* fix build on Debian/squeeze
* bfsync need-upgrade: added command to check if repo needs to be upgraded

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.5:

* added bfsync diff command: textual diffs between last and current version
* fix bug that occured when opening newly created read-only files
* allow restricting access to the filesystem to a group of processes; this
  is useful when running backups, to prevent locate indexing the backup fs
* fix packaging: ship sqlexport, too; bfsync sql-export should work now

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.4:

* added bfsync sql-export command: export file lists to Postgres DB
* added bfsync find-missing command: show file names where file contents are
  unavailable
* added bfsync copy-expire command: copy expire tags from a remote repo
* added bfsync get-repo-id command: query unique repository id
* HashCache remove st_dev from stat hash to work better with external devices,
  which can change device major/minor numbers
* reimplemented HashCache in C++: better performance, less memory usage
* rename expire config values: use "-" instead of "_" for config key names

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.3:

* fixed crash that could sometimes occur during bfsyncfs umount
* improved memory usage of bfsync clone/pull
* various performance optimizations
* new bfsyncfs -c option: enables FUSE cacheing
* added bfsyncca utility to set cpu affinity
* bfsync config-set: allow changing config even if db needs recovery

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.2:

* added bfsync upgrade command: upgrade repository from previous version(s)
* added bfsync expire command: automated deletion of old versions
* added bfsync (un)delete-version: allows deleting old versions, so that
  old contents will be removed during gc
* added bfsync config-set: allows modifying repository configuration
* added bfsync need-continue: returns true if bfsync continue needs to be run
* added bfsync need-recover command: returns true if bfsync recover needs to be run
* improved pull/clone performance: applying link deletions is a lot faster now
* allow using other remote shells than ssh (usually rsh is faster if encryption
  is not needed)
* added bfsync transfer-bench, which measures transfer speed
* allow big letters (A-Z) in config files without quoting

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.1:

* added bfsync new-files command: show new/changed files for a given version
* added bfsync disk-usage command: generate disk usage statistics
* support bfsync --version
* check version compatibility during mount / remote connections
* added disk usage information to FuSE filesystem (support du)
* correctly determine user name when running from cron
* use xz -6 for history diffs (not -9) to better support low mem machines
* minor fixes

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.3.0:

* use Berkeley DB instead of SQLITE to store history
* made code more scalable: storing lots of files (5.000.000) is possible now

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.2.0:

* almost completely rewrote all code
* use SQLite DB instead of git to store history
* use FuSE filesystem to get rid of explicit bfsync add/mv/...
* use python package for bfsync
* allow accessing old versions directly in the FuSE filesystem
* proper history: clone/pull/... will now get current and all past versions
* store more metadata (like user id, group id, devices, hard links,...)
* added code to ask user in case of conflicts / merge decisions

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.1.1:

* improved check output (added missing stdout flush)
* improved hash cache (less time consuming rechecks required)
* fix cache saving / unwanted exit in get
* fix problem than caused repo-files command not to work at all

Overview of Changes in bfsync-0.1.0:
