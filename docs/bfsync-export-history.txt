bfsync-export-history(1)
========================

NAME
----
bfsync-export-history - Export history from a repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync export-history' <dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command exports the history of the current repo to `<dir>`, which will
be created during export. The command works for both, master repositories
and checkouts. Once the history is exported, the history can be used for
creating a new master repository using 'bfsync init' with the same history.

This is especially useful if your master repository is no longer available
but you still own one or more checkouts. Using history export, a new master
repository for the checkouts can be created, which has the same history
and is compatible to the checkouts.
