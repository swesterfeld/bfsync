=============

NAME
----
bfsync-put - Transfer file contents to repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync put' [--rsh <remote_shell>] [<repo>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Transfer file contents from local checkout to `<repo>`.  The repository
`<repo>` should contain a bfsync checkout of the repository you're working
with. First, `bfsync put` will make a list of file contents (SHA1 content
hashes) that are referenced by the repository `<repo>`, but not are available
there.  Then, it will check if any of these file contents is available in the
local repository and transfer these to the repository `<repo>`.

If the `<repo>` argument is missing, the default from the config file is used.

OPTIONS
-------
--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.
