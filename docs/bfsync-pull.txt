NAME
----
bfsync-pull - Pull changes from master repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync pull' [--ff-only] [--rsh <remote_shell>]
            [--always-local] [--always-master] [--always-both]
            [<repo>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Pull changes from master repository. If there are new local commits and new
commits in the master repository, pull will merge the local and master history.
See section "MERGES" of linkbfsync:bfsync[1] for details.

If the `<repo>` argument is missing, the default from the config file is used.

OPTIONS
-------
--ff-only::
    Only perform fast-forward pulls, where the local history has no new commits
    compared to the master history. For merges, which occur if both, the master
    history and the local history, have new commits, this option will make
    pull abort without changing anything.

--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.

--always-local::
    If merge conflicts occur, automatically resolve them by always choosing the
    local version. This is mainly intended for unit testing scripts.

--always-master::
    If merge conflicts occur, automatically resolve them by always choosing the
    master version. This is mainly intended for unit testing scripts.

--always-both::
    If merge conflicts occur, automatically resolve them by always choosing
    both versions. This is mainly intended for unit testing scripts.
