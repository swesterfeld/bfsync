bfsync-get(1)
=============

NAME
----
bfsync-get - Transfer file contents from repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync get' [--rsh <remote_shell>] [<repo>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Transfer file contents from repository `<repo>` to the local repository. The
repository `<repo>` should contain a bfsync checkout of the repository you're
working with. First, `bfsync get` will make a list of file contents (SHA1
content hashes) that are referenced by the local repository, but not available.
Then, it will check if any of these file contents are available in the
repository `<repo>` and transfer these to the local repository.

A `<repo>` path with a ":" is interpreted as remote path, a path without ":" is
a local path.  Examples for remote paths are
`stefan@server:/repos/files.bfsync` or `server:some/dir`.

If the `<repo>` argument is missing, the default from the config file is used.

OPTIONS
-------
--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.
