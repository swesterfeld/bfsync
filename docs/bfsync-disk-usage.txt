bfsync-disk-usage(1)
====================

NAME
----
bfsync-disk-usage - Generate disk usage information

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync disk-usage' [-h]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This generates disk usage information. The disk usage information is designed
to see what could be freed when removing older versions. Therefore, it will
start with the most recent version, since you'll want to keep this version in
any case. This first size will be the size required to store one full backup
(for the backup use case).

Then, older versions are examined. Only the sizes of the files are counted that
need to be kept additionally to be able to retrieve the older version
completely. Since most of the files will be unchanged when compared to the
current version, the increments will usually be small.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
    This option uses human readable sizes (like 15G for 15 gigabytes), omitting
    it will print the sizes in bytes.
