NAME
----
bfsync-clone - Clone a bfsync repo from a bfsync master repo

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync clone' [ -u ] [ -c <cache_size_mb> ] [--rsh <remote_shell>]
             <repo> [ <dest-dir> ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Initialize new cloned bfsync repo from bfsync master repo. If `<dest-dir>` is
not specified, bfsync clone will generate a directory name from the repository
name, otherwise it will clone into the directory `<dest-dir>`.

OPTIONS
-------
-u::
    If `-u` is given, bfsync clone will set the `"use-uid-gid"` option in the config
    file for the cloned repository to 1. This means  that  upon mount,  the  user
    id  settings and group id settings for files/directories will be taken from the
    repository. This will only make sense if all machines that access the data have
    the same uid/gid numbers. The default (without `-u`) is  not  to use  the
    uid/gid numbers,  which should be perfect for almost every use case except for
    backups.

-c <cache_size_mb>::
    The cache size is the amount of shared memory that will be used as database
    cache size. It defaults to 16 MB, which is fine  for  repositories that
    contain  a  small amount of files. For synchronizing big files between
    different hosts, that will usually work. If the amount of files is large (>
    100.000), you need a larger cache size. At least 100 MB cache per 1.000.000
    files stored should  be used, more is better, if you can afford it.

--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.
