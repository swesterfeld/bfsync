bfsync-collect(1)
================

NAME
----
bfsync-collect - Scan directory for file contents required by repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync collect' <dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command allows using a non-checkout directory `<dir>` to populate a
repository with file contents. It computes the SHA1 hash of all files in the
directory, and copies those files with matching hash that are required for the
local repository to its object directory.

This is for instance useful if you're converting from an old bfsync format to
the new one, because by using collect you don't have to retransfer the file
contents.
