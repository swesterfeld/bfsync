bfsync-delete-version(1)
========================

NAME
----
bfsync-delete-version - Delete one or more versions from repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync delete-version' <vrange1> [<vrange2> ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command tags the version(s) `<vrange1>`, `<vrange2>`, ... as deleted,
where single numbers are possible:

----
$ bfsync delete-version 10
----

or version ranges:

----
$ bfsync delete-version 10-20
----

Once deleted, these versions become invisible (in the `.commits` directory, in
the `bfsync log` and so on). Files contents that are only used in deleted
versions are removed during `bfsync gc`, and will not be retransferred for
instance during `bfsync get`.
