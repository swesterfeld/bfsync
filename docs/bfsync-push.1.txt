NAME
----
bfsync-push - Push changes to master repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync push' [--rsh <remote_shell>] [<repo>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Push new local commits that are not yet part of the history of the master repository
`<repo>` to the master repostory.

If the `<repo>` argument is missing, the default from the config file will be used.

Note that `bfsync push` and `bfsync pull` only transfers the history
information (what files and directories exists, and what SHA1 their contents
have). To transfer the contents of the files, `bfsync put` or `bfsync get` can
be used.

OPTIONS
-------
--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.
