NAME
----
bfsync-diff - Diff text file changes between last and current version

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync diff' <filename> ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run diff to compare the last and the current version of `<filename>`. Only
files can be compared, not whole directories. However, specifying more than one
file to diff is supported.

Using this command is useful for text files that have been changed, but useless
for binary files.
