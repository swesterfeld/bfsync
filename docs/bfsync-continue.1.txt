bfsync-continue(1)
==================

NAME
----
bfsync-continue - Continue previously interrupted command

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync continue' [<repo>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are some operations, such as `commit` or `revert`, that must be finished
completely once they are started, to ensure that the database is in a
consistent state. If such an operation is interrupted, for instance because of
a power failure, user abort (^C) or because the process was killed, it needs to
be completed before the repository can be used for something else. A
filesystem with an unfinished command can only be used in readonly mode until
that operation is finished.

The `continue` command can be used to finish an unfinished operation, either
with the repository directory as argument, or if that is not there, the
repository will be choosen according to the directory "continue" was started
in.
