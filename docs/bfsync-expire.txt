NAME
----
bfsync-expire - Mark old versions as deleted to reduce disk usage

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync expire'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The expire command was designed mainly for deleting the contents of old
backups, although it will work on any repository.

During expire, the tags *daily*, *weekly*, *monthly* and *yearly* will be
assigned to the versions that are daily, weekly, monthly or yearly backups. The
expire configuration will determine which version is - for instance - a monthly
backup. It could be the first backup of the month, or the last backup of the
month.

Finally, after all versions have been tagged according to the expire
configuration, expire will mark versions deleted that shouldn't be kept. For
each daily/weekly/monthly/yearly backup, expire will keep the N newest backups,
where N is configurable.

The `expire/keep_daily` setting defines how many daily backups expire will
keep, the `expire/keep_weekly` setting defines how many weekly backups expire
will keep, and so on. Finally the setting `expire/keep_most_recent` defines how
many most recent backups expire will keep. Every backup that is not kept due
to one of these settings will be marked deleted.

The settings that affect the expire command are documented in the
"CONFIGURATION" section of linkbfsync:bfsync[1].

Note that while `expire` marks versions as deleted, it doesn't actually delete
the file contents that belong to deleted versions.  Running
linkbfsync:bfsync-gc[1] will delete all file contents that are only in deleted
versions.
