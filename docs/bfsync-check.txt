NAME
----
bfsync-check - Checks local repository for completeness

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync check'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Check tests if the local repository is complete and all file contents and
commit hash objects are present.

Ideally, all file contents that are known to the history of the repository are
available in the objects directory of the repository (which stores one file per
SHA1 hash).

If that is not the case, linkbfsync:bfsync-put[1]/linkbfsync:bfsync-get[1] can
be used to complete the local repository.
