bfsync-copy-expire(1)
=====================

NAME
----
bfsync-copy-expire - Copy expire tags from source to target repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync copy-expire' [--rsh <remote_shell>] <repo>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Usually, the deletion of old versions is done by the `expire` command. If a
repository is replicated using `clone/pull/get`, it is often useful to run the
expire command on the source repository, and copy the resulting tags to the
target repositories using copy-expire. In this way, the same versions that have
been deleted in the source repository will also be deleted in the target
repository.

The source repository is defined by the command line parameter `<repo>`, the
target repostory is defined by the current directory.

OPTIONS
-------
--rsh <remote_shell>::
    This option can be used to set the remote shell used to connect the host; it
    defaults to ssh.
