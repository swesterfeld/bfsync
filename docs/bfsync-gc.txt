============

NAME
----
bfsync-gc - Cleanup unused files

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bfsync gc'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This will check for objects that are present in the local repo, but not used. These
unnecessary files will be deleted to free space.

Files can become unused for instance

* when versions are deleted by `bfsync expire` or `bfsync delete-version`
* when using `bfsync revert`
* if the merge algorithm needs to modify diffs due to merge decisions
  (then the old diff becomes unused)
