--------
[verse]
'bfsync init' [--with-history <history_dir>] <repo_dir>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command will create a new bfsync master repository using `<repo_dir>` as
destination directory. This master repo can then be cloned to create local or
remote checkouts.

OPTIONS
-------
--with-history <history_dir>::
   This option can be used to create a master repository with a specific history,
   which is mostly useful if the original master repository was lost. This is
   however not the common case, but a rare exception.
