bfsync2 TODO:

* check for open files before allowing readonly mode
* better cache expiring for INodeLinks
* background hashing for fs
* merge INodeLinks and INode cache
* detect protocol version
* check permissions for touch

Performance:
============
* use Berkeley DB (with inode-affinity)
* fix redundant inserts (should be updates)
* use infinity as vmax, so that committing doesn't require an update
* cache friendly get would hash and copy file-by-file, since then the data
  is read only once from the physical media

MERGE:
======
* better information for the user
  - change logs
  - inode values

RELEASE:
========
* remove bfsync1 stuff from repo
* add man page(s)
* unclutter output
* history

NEXT RELEASE:
=============
* excludes

==============================================================================================

ENCRYPTED MODE:
* files are stored as continuous stream of encrypted data
* index is stored as pointers into file stream
* splitting (as 16M blocks) enables easy update
* passphrase-derived key
* sha-256 checksum for each block at the beginning
  -> partial writes become invisible
