* allow mv on directory
* automatically try to get from own repo first (for renames)
* age based cache expire
* detect protocol version
* use dict() style api for parse_git_files
* improve file mode tracking
* add should probably have progress indication (for huge adds)
* check_untracked should start walking from the repository root, not root_dir

BFSYNC2:

* basic filesystem:

git/files:
git/files/foo/bar         <- store stat information and blob reference

git/dirs:
git/dirs/foo              <- store stat information for directory foo

git/blobs/<some hash>     <- ensure that blob occurred in repos history

blobs:
blobs/<some hash>         <- store blob data for some files

* overlay filesystem (FUSE):

new/files/foo/bar         <- store stat/content changes for file bar (uncommitted)

new/dirs/foo              <- store stat changes for directory foo

new/rm/foo/bar            <- mark file/directory as removed
