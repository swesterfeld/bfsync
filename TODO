* properly handle copy-on-write() errors (disk full, ...)
* check for open files before allowing readonly mode
* better cache expiring for INodeLinks
* background hashing for fs
* merge INodeLinks and INode cache
* detect protocol version
* check permissions for touch
* rename bfsync.transferutils => bfsync.transfer (and other fooutils => foo)
* remove unused new/ files during revert or gc

Performance:
============
* use Berkeley DB (with inode-affinity)
* fix redundant inserts (should be updates)
* use infinity as vmax, so that committing doesn't require an update
* cache friendly get would hash and copy file-by-file, since then the data
  is read only once from the physical media

MERGE:
======
* better information for the user
  - change logs
  - inode values

RELEASE:
========
* remove bfsync1 stuff from repo
* add man page(s)

NEXT RELEASE:
=============
* excludes
* lock repository during commit, push and pull

==============================================================================================

ENCRYPTED MODE:
* files are stored as continuous stream of encrypted data
* index is stored as pointers into file stream
* splitting (as 16M blocks) enables easy update
* passphrase-derived key
* sha-256 checksum for each block at the beginning
  -> partial writes become invisible
