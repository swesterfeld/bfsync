Transaction Design:
===================
init
 - move initial diff into objects/ dir
 - create initial history entry

push
 - get remote history
 - get local history
 - find common version
 - update remote history
 - get list of required remote history objects
 - transfer objects from local to remote

pull
 - check uncommitted changes
 - get remote history
 - get local history
 - transfer history objects

revert
 - ServerLock
 - delete new links / inodes vmin > new_vmax
 - delete history entries > new_vmax
 - unlock ServerLock

commit
 - scan for new files
 loop (ChangedINodes):
  - integrate new files via hash in inode table
 - generate diff
 - expected hash cmp
 - xz diff
 - store history entry
 - clear changed inodes

clone
 - setup empty repository
 => pull

merge
status
