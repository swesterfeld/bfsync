bfsync is a program that provides git-style revision control for collections of
big files. The contents of the files are managed by bfsync, and a git
repository is used to do version control; in this repo only the hashes of the
actual data files are stored.

For transfer, bfsync needs to be installed on every system that needs to be
accessed. The actual transfer is done using ssh.  Transfer has only be tested
with ssh keys; its highly recommended to use ssh-agent to avoid entering your
password over and over again.

To get more information see:

$ man bfsync
